## ü§î What is This?

This project allows you to use `WARP+` through a subscription, supporting
clients like `Clash`, `Shadowrocket`, etc. The project includes a feature to
replenish `WARP+` traffic, enabling your `WARP+` traffic to be unrestricted
(1GB of traffic every 18 seconds). Additionally, it comes with IP optimization.

It supports one-click deployment through `Docker compose`, so you can enjoy
your private high-speed `WARP+` node without extra hassle!

## üí° Key Features

- üíª Supports clients such as `Clash`, `Surge`, `Shadowrocket`, etc.
-
- üîë Supports setting your own `LicenseKey`.
- üåè Supports IP optimization.
- üêã Supports one-click deployment using `Docker compose`.
- üìï Automatically replenishes `WARP+` traffic, requests are proxied,
  preserving your IP from getting blocked.
- ‚ùì Randomly selects nodes each subscription update, adding a sense of
  randomness to your experience.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install `Docker` and `Docker compose`

- Docker Installation
  Guide: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Docker Compose Installation
  Guide: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 2. Download the Project

### 3. [Optional] Configure `SECRET_KEY`

If you plan to deploy this project on the public internet, it's recommended to
set up the `SECRET_KEY`. Create a `.env.local` file in the project directory
and add the following:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

For more information on environment variables, refer to
[Environment Variables](#-environment-variables).

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Obtain Subscription Link

Visit `http://your_IP:21001`, enter the `SECRET_KEY` and `PUBLIC_URL` (if
configured), and you can get the subscription link.

**üéâ Congratulations, you're all set!**

## üåè Manual IP Optimization

The project includes a pre-optimized list of IPs, but due to the dynamic
nature of `WARP` IPs, there might be cases where IPs become unusable. If you
wish to optimize manually, follow these steps:

If you deployed via `docker-compose`, you can manually execute IP optimization
with the following command in the project directory:

```bash
docker-compose exec warp-clash python3 app.py optimize
```

Otherwise, you can execute the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python3 app.py optimize
```

## üîß Environment Variables

Yes, you can configure this project using environment variables. Simply create
a `.env.local` file and add the required environment variables.

Here are the available environment variables:

| REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT     | `0`                               | Limits requests to once every X seconds. This feature is unstable; it's recommended not to enable it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SECRET_KEY             | `None`                            | Used to protect the subscription link. If not configured, no `SECRET_KEY` input is required to get the link.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| SHARE_SUBSCRIPTION     | `False`                           | If you want to share subscriptions with the community but doesn't want your account information to be publicly accessible or modified, you can set this to `True`. In this case, accessing the subscription link does not require entering the `SECRET_KEY`, but for other operations, the `SECRET_KEY` is still required. |

### üìù Configuration Example

If you set `SECRET_KEY` to `123456` and plan to share the subscription with
the community, your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```env
SECRET_KEY=123456
SHARE_SUBSCRIPTION=True
```

## üß∞ Advanced Operations

**Please note that if you set `SECRET_KEY`, you need to add the `key`
parameter at the end of the URL**, for example:

```text
http://your_IP:21001/some/api/actions?key=your_secret_key
```

### Resetting the `PublicKey` and `PrivateKey` of an Account

The project supports resetting the `PublicKey` and `PrivateKey` by requesting
the following interface:

```bash
curl -X POST http://host:port/api/account/reset_key
```

After resetting, it is necessary to re-acquire the subscription content;
otherwise, it may not be usable.

### Setting Your Own `LicenseKey`

If you already have a `WARP+` `LicenseKey`, you can set it through the
following interface:

```bash
curl -X POST http://host:port/api/account/update_license -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"license_key\": \"your_license_key\"}"
```

Please note that when you set the `LicenseKey`, your `PublicKey` and
`PrivateKey` will be reset, and you will need to re-acquire the subscription
content.

### Using IPv6 Preference

In principle, this service obtains IPv6 addresses by reading
the `config/result_v6.csv` file. Therefore, you can run the IP preference
function on a server that supports IPv6 to obtain IPv6 addresses. The list of
obtained access addresses only needs to be written into
the `config/result_v6.csv` file. Compared to running the IP preference function
in a Docker container, this method is more straightforward.

If you need to run the IP preference function in a Docker container, you can use
the `docker-compose_ipv6.yaml` file to make the Docker image support IPv6.
Before running, please ensure that your server supports IPv6 and add the
following content to /etc/docker/daemon.json in the Docker service (remember to
restart the Docker service):

```json
{
  "experimental": true,
  "ip6tables": true,
  "ipv6": true,
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8:1::/64"
}
```

If you have previously run the Docker service, please stop the previous service
before running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Then, you can run the Docker service with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_ipv6.yaml up -d
```
